‚ÄúSOC Analyst Portfolio showcasing log analysis, detection engineering, incident response, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK mapping.‚Äù


# üõ°Ô∏è Amy Leon ‚Äì SOC Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  
I am currently completing a **Postgraduate Diploma in Cybersecurity at NCI (Ireland)** and building hands-on projects to strengthen my skills in **Security Operations (SOC), Incident Response, and Threat Detection**.  

This portfolio demonstrates practical SOC use cases ‚Äî from log analysis and detection engineering to incident reporting and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
