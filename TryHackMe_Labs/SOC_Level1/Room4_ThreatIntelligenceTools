## Overview
This room introduces several open-source and community-based threat intelligence tools used by SOC analysts to identify, verify, and enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  
It focuses on practical platforms that can be integrated into everyday SOC workflows for faster investigation and response.

## Tools Covered
- **Urlscan.io** – captures and analyses website snapshots, IPs, resources, and technologies.  
- **Abuse.ch projects** – includes MalwareBazaar (malware samples), FeodoTracker (botnet C2 IPs), SSL Blacklist (malicious certificates/JA3s), URLhaus and ThreatFox (malicious URLs and IOCs).  
- **PhishTool** – email analysis platform that helps parse headers, attachments, and links to identify phishing activity.  
- **VirusTotal** – multi-engine file and URL scanning for quick malware reputation checks.  
- **AbuseIPDB** – reputation scoring for potentially malicious IPs.  
- **AlienVault OTX** – community-driven threat sharing platform for IOCs, campaigns, and indicators.  

## Key Learnings
- Using multiple CTI sources helps validate findings and reduce false positives.  
- Threat intelligence tools give valuable context for SOC investigations — confirming whether an alert or IOC is part of a wider campaign.  
- Most platforms support APIs, which makes it possible to automate enrichment within SIEM or SOAR systems.  
- MISP and STIX/TAXII support structured, automated sharing of intelligence across teams or organisations.

## Practical Takeaways
- Automate IOC lookups (IPs, hashes, domains) against multiple feeds to confirm confidence levels.  
- Integrate CTI feeds into SIEMs like Splunk or Security Onion to flag known malicious indicators.  
- Use JA3 fingerprints and SSL Blacklists to detect recurring malicious TLS traffic.  
- For phishing cases, analyse email headers, extract hashes from attachments, and verify through VirusTotal or MalwareBazaar.

## Scenario Exercises (Email Hash Analysis)
Two short scenarios involved examining `.eml` files to extract SHA256 hashes from attachments and check them against threat intelligence sources:

- **Scenario 1 (Email2.eml):** After extracting the attachment’s SHA256, a lookup in Cisco Talos flagged it as **HIDDENEXT/Worm.Gen**, confirming it as a known worm.  
- **Scenario 2 (Email3.eml):** The attachment `Sales_Receipt 5606.xls` produced a SHA256 linked to the **Dridex** malware family.  

**SOC takeaway:**  
Always calculate hashes from suspicious attachments and cross-check them against CTI platforms (Talos, VirusTotal, MalwareBazaar, OTX) to quickly confirm malware type and threat relevance.
