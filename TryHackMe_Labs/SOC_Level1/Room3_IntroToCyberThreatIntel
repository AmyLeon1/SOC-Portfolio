## Overview
This room provides an introduction to **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** — how security teams gather, analyse, and apply intelligence to defend against adversaries.  
It explains the **intelligence lifecycle** (Direction → Collection → Processing → Analysis → Dissemination → Feedback) and how CTI supports SOC and incident response activities.

## Key Learnings
- **Types of intelligence:**
  - *Strategic* — high-level insights for management and risk decisions.
  - *Operational* — details on adversary campaigns, motivations, and TTPs.
  - *Tactical* — specific IOCs (IPs, hashes, domains) for detection.
  - *Technical* — raw data feeds (logs, malware samples).
- **Sources of CTI:** open-source intelligence (OSINT), internal logs, threat feeds, dark web monitoring, and ISAC/ISAO sharing.
- **Frameworks:** MITRE ATT&CK for mapping adversary techniques; STIX/TAXII for structured intelligence sharing.
- **Benefits for SOCs:**
  - Adds context to alerts (who, why, how).
  - Enables prioritisation of incidents based on threat relevance.
  - Improves proactive defense through indicator-based detections.

## SOC Takeaways
- Incorporate CTI feeds into SIEM correlation rules to identify known bad indicators.
- Use CTI to **enrich alerts**: match source IPs, domains, and hashes to threat actor data.
- Create watchlists from OSINT feeds to detect ongoing campaigns.
- Regularly map threat actor TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK for detection coverage assessment.
- Example integration: feed MISP IOCs into Splunk or Security Onion to automate alert correlation.
