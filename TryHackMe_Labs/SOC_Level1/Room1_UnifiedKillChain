## Overview
This room introduced the **Unified Kill Chain**, which extends the MITRE ATT&CK and Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain models.  
It outlines **18 phases** of adversary operations — from initial reconnaissance through objectives and post-compromise activities.  
The main takeaway is that the Unified Kill Chain provides a more complete, **end-to-end mapping** of adversarial behavior across both **pre-compromise** and **post-compromise** stages.

## Key Learnings
- Combines strengths of both MITRE ATT&CK (tactics/techniques) and Cyber Kill Chain (attack lifecycle).
- Useful for **SOC correlation** — mapping alerts and IOCs to kill chain phases improves detection coverage.
- Encourages a **defense-in-depth** mindset: monitor and detect early, not only during exploitation.

## SOC Takeaways
- Use Unified Kill Chain mapping to prioritise detections across different attack stages.  
- Maintain coverage matrix (e.g., “Detection → Kill Chain Phase”) to identify monitoring gaps.
- Example use: map Windows Event 4625 (failed logons) to “Credential Access → Credential Use” phase.
